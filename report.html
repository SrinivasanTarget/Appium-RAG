Starting Appium and launch the app from code - IOS","01\\nINTRODUCTION TO APPIUM","Appium is an open source mobile app UI testing framework. You can test all types of mobile apps","and perform automation test on physical devices as well as on emulators and simulators. Appium does","does not have a dependency on mobile device OS and It supports cross-platform app testing as a","as a single API works for both Android and iOS. Appium supports many popular languag-es like C,","like C, PHP, Python, C#, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, etc.","How Appium works?","When Appium is installed then a server is setup on your machine that exposes the REST API. It","API. It receives a command request from the client and executes that command on Android or iOS","or iOS mobile devices. Then it responds back with an HTTP response. It uses mobile test automation","frameworks like Apple instruments or UIAutomator2 to drive the UI of apps.","We will learn more about Appium Architecture in detail in the 3rd chapter of this ebook. \\n01","02\\nAPPROACHES TO\\nTEST AUTOMATION","There are two approaches for mobile test automation, Image-based and Object-based","approach. Let&#x27;s understand both in detail. \\nImage-Based Approach for Test Automation","The object-based approach of test automation This technique of object identi\\ufb01cation is based on the","on the image processing attributes of the objects","in the Application Under Test (AUT). Example: Automate user options like \\"click, type, drag-drop,","mouse actions, etc.\\" Visual veri\\ufb01cation of the expected output        Not dependent on the platform","platform underneath         Can be used to automate emulators as well as a real device.","This technique of test automation is based on recognizing the nativity of the objects in AUT. This","nativity reorganization process for each individual object in the application is carried out using","out using di\\ufb00erent attributes that are assigned to the object. It is used to extract the","the application object identi\\ufb01er with its properties from the actual native oper-ating system","system source code, just like the developer used. This is an accurate and fast method to recognize","recognize the buttons, lists and other objects used by the application. One drawback of the","of the object-based approach is that the recognition of the individual attributes Merits Demerits","Easy to automateCan accurately test GUI and rendering of applicationsUseful for automating multiple","multiple devices with-out getting into details of each platform technologyImperative for end-user","end-user experienceHighly dependent on the resolutionCannot run in backgroundSlower than object","object level recognition as it requires scanning of complete screen","03Image - based Approach","of the object involved restricts these techniques ability to function in test scenarios that require","require","third-party application access. This reduces the automation coverage of utilizing this technique.","Merits Demerits","100% accuracy in object \\ufb01ndingFaster than image-based approachSupports multiple languagesDoes not","not capture GUI defectsLanguages and implementation are di\\ufb00erent for di\\ufb00erent platformsIt is","is completely functional, does not defect UX defects","Which approach should we choose?","As we have seen, both approaches have their pros and cons. To get better results, you can merge","can merge both approaches and think about devising a hybrid test automation solution. The","The combination of OCR (image based) and native (object-based) approach allows users to build a","build a single script that will be portable across di\\ufb00erent devices. It will make your automation","robust and e\\ufb03cient and allows the users to con\\ufb01dently detect the relevant native and GUI defect","defect within the mobile application.","04Object - based Approach","03\\nAPPIUM OVERVIEW\\nAND ARCHITECTURE","Appium is an HTTP server that manages Web Driver sessions. On iOS devices, Appium proxies","command to a UI automation script running on Mac Instruments environment. Apple provides an","an application called instruments which are used to do a lot of activities like pro\\ufb01ling,","pro\\ufb01ling, controlling and building iOS apps. It also provides an automation component where you can","you can write some commands in JavaScript which uses UI Automation APIs which interact with the app","the app user inter-face. Appium uses these same libraries to automate iOS apps.","The Webdriver Script sends a command in the form of HTTP (JSWP) to the Appium Server. Then","the Appium Server will then decide as per the request which driver should be initiated. So, in this","in this case, the Appium Server will initiate the XCUITest driver and it will pass the request to","to the Web-driverAgent which is an IPA (WebdriverAgent.xcproj) developed by Facebook.","Facebook. WebdriverAgent is responsible to send the command to the Application Under Test (AUT) to","(AUT) to carry out the actions in the app. Then the response will be sent to the Webdriver Script","Script through the Appium server.                   Only iOS 9.3 and above version are supported by","by the XCUITest Driver. You can \\ufb01nd all the capabili-ties for XCUITest Driver in the link mentioned","mentioned below.https:/ /github.com/appium/appium-xcuitest-driver.","WebDriverScript\\n06Appium Architecture for IOS","The situation is very similar in the case of Android where Appium proxies command to a UIAuto-","mator2 test case running on the device. UIAutomator2 is Android&#x27;s UI automation framework which","which supports running JUnit test cases directly into the device into the command line. It uses","It uses Java as the programing language but Appium will make it run from any of the web drivers","drivers sup-ported languages.","Appium Philosophy\\nTest the same app you submit to the marketplace.","You shouldn\\u2019t be locked into a speci\\ufb01c language or framework to write and run tests.","Use a standard automation speci\\ufb01cation and API.","Build a large and thriving open source community e\\ufb00ort.1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n07Appium Architecture for IOS","04\\nAPPIUM SETUP\\nFOR WINDOWS","There are four steps required to setup Appium, they are enabling the Android device for test, Test","environment setup, Appium Con\\ufb01gurations, Launch the app on the device. \\nEnable the\\nAndroid","Android\\nDevice for TestTest\\nEnvironment\\nSetupAppium\\nCon\\ufb01gurationsLaunch App\\non Device","on Device\\nPre-requisites for using Appium","Android Developer Options in device An Android device with OS 4.2+","AUT(Application Under Test) \\ufb01le (.apk) Phone USB Drivers  Java (JDK) Android Studio (SDK) Eclipse","Eclipse Selenium Standalone JAR Appium Java Client Appium for Windows .NET Framework 4.5","Every Android smartphone contains a secret set of Android developer options which are used by","app developers who need additional functions to test their apps they are making for Android","Android devices.
