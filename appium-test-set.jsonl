It can test all types of mobile apps and perform automation test on physical devices, emulators, and simulators. It does not have a dependency on mobile device OS and supports cross-platform app testing as a single API works for both Android and iOS. Appium supports many popular languages like C, PHP, Python, C#, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, etc. When Appium is installed, a server is set up on your machine that exposes the REST API. It receives a command request from the client and executes that command on Android or iOS mobile devices, then responds back with an HTTP response. It uses mobile test automation frameworks like Apple instruments or UIAutomator2 to drive the UI of apps.","reference_context":"Document 3: Appium is an open source mobile app UI testing framework.

It receives a command request from the client and executes that command on Android or iOS mobile devices. Then it responds back with an HTTP response. It uses mobile test automation frameworks like Apple instruments or UIAutomator2 to drive the UI of apps.\nWe will learn more about Appium Architecture in detail in the 3rd chapter of this ebook. \n01","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"distracting element","seed_document_id":3,"distracting_context":"of the object involved restricts these techniques ability to function in test scenarios that require \nthird-party application access.

To get better results, you can merge both approaches and think about devising a hybrid test automation solution. The combination of OCR (image based) and native (object-based) approach allows users to build a single script that will be portable across di\ufb00erent devices.
